def CalculateShapeFactorFromBinaryAndContour(largest_contour, binary_img_otsu, percent):
    """
    Calculates the shape factor based on a given contour and binary image, 
    following the Van Sluytman Shape Factor (2012). This function processes 
    the provided contour and binary image to calculate parameters `a` and 
    `b`, and determine the shape factor.

    Args:
        largest_contour (numpy.ndarray): The contour of the particle or object 
            to be analyzed, typically obtained from contour detection methods.
        binary_img_otsu (numpy.ndarray): The binary image of the object used 
            for visualizing the contour and quadrilateral.
        percent (float): The percentage used to define the minimum length for 
            finding close points on the contour.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - ShapeFactor (float): The calculated shape factor, which is the 
              ratio `a/b` based on the bounding quadrilateral of the particle.
            - a (float): The value of the A parameter, calculated from the 
              distances between the first and last points in each subset.
            - b (float): The value of the B parameter, calculated from the 
              distances between consecutive points on the quadrilateral.
            - fig (numpy.ndarray): The visual representation of the contour, 
              quadrilateral, and first/last points.

    Description:
        This function processes the provided largest contour and binary image 
        to calculate the shape factor. It first finds the enclosing 
        quadrilateral around the contour, defines the minimum length to find 
        close points on the contour, and divides those points into subsets 
        based on proximity to the edges of the quadrilateral. It then 
        calculates the A and B parameters from the distances between points 
        and computes the shape factor as `a / b`. A visual representation of 
        the contour, quadrilateral, and first/last points is also generated.

    Steps:
        - The function uses the largest contour and binary image to find 
          the enclosing quadrilateral.
        - Close points on the contour are identified based on a distance 
          threshold.
        - These points are divided into subsets corresponding to the edges 
          of the quadrilateral.
        - The first and last points from each subset are used to calculate 
          the A parameter.
        - The B parameter is calculated from the distances between 
          consecutive points on the quadrilateral.
        - The shape factor is computed as the ratio `a / b`.
        - A visual output is created, displaying the relevant features.

    Notes:
        - The function assumes that the contour and binary image have been 
          properly extracted from the input image or object.
        - The visualization is returned as a NumPy array representing the 
          generated figure.

def CreateContourMultiple(image_path):
    """
    Creates and displays contours for multiple particles in an image after 
    applying Otsu's thresholding. The function extracts contours of all 
    detected particles and generates binary masks for each one.

    Args:
        image_path (str): The file path to the input image containing 
            multiple particles or objects.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - "contour" (numpy.ndarray): The contour of each particle 
              detected in the image.
            - "binary_mask" (numpy.ndarray): The binary mask of each 
              particle, where the particle is filled and the background 
              is black.

    Description:
        This function processes an image to remove border objects and 
        then applies Otsu's thresholding to convert the image to binary. 
        It then finds contours in the thresholded image, detects multiple 
        particles, and creates binary masks for each particle. The binary 
        mask fills the detected particle with white (255) and the rest of 
        the image remains black (0). Each particle's contour and binary 
        mask are stored in a dictionary, and the binary masks are displayed 
        using Matplotlib.

    Steps:
        - The image is processed using the `remove_border_objects` function 
          to remove unwanted objects at the border.
        - Otsu's thresholding is applied to binarize the image.
        - Contours are found in the thresholded image.
        - A binary mask is created for each particle, where the particle is 
          filled in and the background is black.
        - The function stores each particle's contour and binary mask in a 
          dictionary.
        - The binary masks for each particle are displayed using Matplotlib.

    Notes:
        - The function is intended for images containing multiple particles 
          or objects, each of which will be separated into its own binary mask.
        - The `particles_data_otsu` dictionary stores the contour and mask 
          for each particle, labeled as "Particle_1", "Particle_2", etc.
        - The visualization shows the binary masks for each detected particle 
          in a subplot.

    Description:
        This function processes multiple particles detected in an image and 
        calculates the shape factor for each one using the Van Sluytman Shape 
        Factor method. For each particle:
        - The function finds the enclosing quadrilateral and calculates the 
          shape factor by dividing parameter `a` by parameter `b`.
        - The results are logged to a CSV file that includes metadata such as 
          the alloy type, temperature, and heat treatment duration.
        - A summary array `ShapeFactorAllImage` is created, containing all the 
          calculated shape factors, with the mean value appended at the end.
        - The total number of particles analyzed is also returned.

    Steps:
        - A CSV file is created (or appended) with the name based on the alloy, 
          temperature, and heat treatment duration.
        - For each particle, the shape factor is calculated and logged to the 
          CSV file along with metadata.
        - The function prints each calculated shape factor and the final array 
          of shape factors including the mean.

    Notes:

          treatment duration, with spaces and special characters replaced.
        - The function assumes that the `particles_data_otsu` dictionary 
          contains valid contours and binary masks for each particle.

          shape factors followed by their mean.

       - Information regarding the alloy type, temperature, and heat treatment 
         duration is collected from the user.

         directory with a name based on the alloy, temperature, and duration 
         information provided.
